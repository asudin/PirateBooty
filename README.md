# PirateBooty
Pirate Booty is a platformer where the player takes on the task to kill endless waves of enemy pirates, while guarding his treasure. The player scores when he is picking a new weapon crate. Upon being killed the game is restarted with the score being nullified. 

The game was created as a final project for the Agava Unity Developer online course.
